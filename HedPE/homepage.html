            <p>(Hed)PE is a G-Punk band from Huntington Beach, California. When the group formed in 1994, hip-hop and rap music was reaching the peak of its youth, and had become mainstream, with styles like gangsta and crunk coming to the fore, it was clear
                that hip hop was yearning to break its mould and evolve. They introduced a unique style of nu metal, Caliofornia punk rock and gangsta rap, which later became known as G-Punk. They came to the attention of several labels with their energetic
                stage shows at venues around LA and other Californian cities. </p><br>

            <p>(Hed)PE finally signed a deal with Live Records in 1997, and burst onto the scene with their first, self-titled album. After three albums in total on Jive Records, they left to become an independent act. Hed PE was signed with Suburban Noize
                Records from 2006 until 2010.</p>

            <p> Since 2014, the band has been signed with Pavement Music. Since then, the band has become known for its involvement in the 9/11 Truth movement, referencing it in many of their song lyrics and concerts, as well as the concept of the album New
                World Orphans.</p>

            <p>To date, (Hed) PE has released twelve studio albums, one live album and three compilation albums. The band was formed by vocalist Jared Gomes, also known as "M.C.U.D." (MC Underdog),[ and guitarist Wes Geer, who became friends amidst the Orange
                County hardcore punk scene. Gomes and Geer recruited guitarist Chizad, bassist Mawk, drummer B.C. Vaught and DJ Product © 1969. They named the group "Hed", which stands for "higher education". The band built a following with their energetic
                performances at local venues, and released the self-financed extended play, Church of Realities. Legal issues forced Hed to change their name, adding "PE", which stood for "Planetary Evolution”. “It was later changed to Planet Earth” (Hed)
                PE signed with Jive Records, releasing their self-titled debut album in 1997. In his review of the album, AllMusic's Steve Huey wrote "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well
                with late-'90s metal and punk fans."[17] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes is quoted as saying "We had
                these romantic visions of the music industry, and we thought it would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably the worst thing that could have happened. [...] We've had offers from
                Sony and others that we can't take because we owe Jive so much money."</p>
